# Solidity-Practice

 - This directory is created to learn Solidity.
 - It contains all the code that I would practice to master solidity.

 ## Info

 - It is a contract-based language. That means it basically used to write smart contracts in EVM.
 - It is inspired from C++, Python and JavaScript.
 - It is a statically typed language, that means we need to speciffy data types at compile time only, unlike python
 - Each smart contract deployed in Block chain is immutable in nature.
