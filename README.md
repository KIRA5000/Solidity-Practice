# Solidity-Practice

 - This directory is created to learn Solidity.
 - It contains all the code that I would practice to master solidity.

 ## Info

 ### BlockChain Info
 - Satoshi Nakamote, published a Bitcoin Whitepaper in 2008, which worked a a foundation of our current bitcoin.
 - Titled: Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System
 - This paper described a way of exchanging a currency, Bitcoin, that combines cryptography, computer science, and game theory in its design and implementation.
 - In other words a blockchain is a decentralized ledger that records transactions or activity between two participants permanently with verification.
 - This verification comes in the form of reviewing cryptographic functions and timestamps. 

 ### Solidity Info
 - It is a contract-based language. That means it basically used to write smart contracts in EVM.
 - It is inspired from C++, Python and JavaScript.
 - It is a statically typed language, that means we need to speciffy data types at compile time only, unlike python
 - Each smart contract deployed in Block chain is immutable in nature.
 

## Compiler installation

This step is not needed if you plan to use remix
```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ethereum/ethereum
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ethereum/ethereum-dev
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install solc
```

## Build Tool

```
https://remix.ethereum.org/
```
